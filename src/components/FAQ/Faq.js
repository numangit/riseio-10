                        <Accordion.Body className="fs-6">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. </Accordion.Body>

                            Firebase offers numerous easy-to-use SDKs, efficient back-end services, and user interface libraries for authenticating the users on the application. Typically, it takes months to establish a functional authentication process, but with Firebase, the whole system can be set up in minutes and less than 15 lines of code. Most importantly, firebase provides a very high level of security.

The component will simply check the current user state from the user, destructured from useContext hook. The private route component renders child components (children) if the user is logged in. If not logged in the user is redirected to the login page with the return url passed in the Navigate component.</Accordion.Body>
