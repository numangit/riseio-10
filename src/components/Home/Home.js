                        <Accordion.Body className="bg-dark rounded text-white fs-6">Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. </Accordion.Body>

                            Firebase offers numerous easy-to-use SDKs, efficient back-end services, and user interface libraries for authenticating the users on the application. Typically, it takes months to establish a functional authentication process, but with Firebase, the whole system can be set up in minutes and less than 15 lines of code. Most importantly, firebase provides a very high level of security.
